<p style="text-align:center;">I'm a postdoctoral data scientist in Ithaca, NY. I obtained my Ph.D. in computational and theoretical chemistry from Cornell University for insights into the data-driven design and large-scale application of chemical physical models. I love working with great people, turning data into insight, and developing algorithms to do things that weren't possible before. Interested in working together? Feel free to contact me!</p>
