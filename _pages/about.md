I have 5 years of experience constructing and analyzing chemical data sets with a strong publication record emphasizing the benchmarking and development of predictive machine learning models. I love using data to get to the bottom of things, whether that be using ML models to tackle the polymer recycling problem, elucidate fundamental diffusion mechanisms in liquid water, or provide insight into quantum chemical methods. Conversely, I spend my free time getting to the top of things -- Rock climbing, hiking, running (hills!) etc..

## Work Experience

### Postdoctoral Research Associate  
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (*May 2023 - Present*)
- Engineered deep learning pipeline to guide the experimental valorization of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to pre-recycled strengths
- Developed sensitivity analysis technique to elucidate the roles of data and physical constraints on the accuracy of quantum chemistry approximations and suggest routes towards improvement

### Graduate Research Assistant  
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (*Aug. 2017 - May 2023*)
- Constructed a new quantum chemical approximation that leverages both machine learning and physical principles, reliably decreasing error by ~15%
- Designed, built, and analyzed two benchmark-quality quantum chemical databases to diagnose shortcomings in approximate quantum chemistry methods, resulting in a new general error analysis framework
- Developed an efficient black box algorithm to estimate electron interaction energies in large-scale systems, thereby extending applicability to systems orders of magnitude larger than historically possible
- Selected to participate in fully funded 3 month long program to define future research goals for the field at the UCLA Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics
- Mentored 6 undergraduate researchers across 4 distinct quantum chemistry projects

### Undergraduate Researcher
St. Olaf College, Northfield, MN (*Aug. 2015 - Aug. 2017*)
- Awarded competitive St. Olaf Center for Interdisciplinary Research Fellowship for outstanding research bridging chemistry, mathematics, and computer science
- Designed and implemented an efficient algorithm for high-resolution image analysis of high-speed gas flows
- Served as formal consultant for other undergraduate researchers with mathematics, statistics, and computer science questions

### Visiting Undergraduate Research Assistant  
MIT, Cambridge, MA (*June 2015 - Aug. 2015*)
- Reconstructed historical Saharan dust transport over the Atlantic ocean by analyzing deep-sea sediment samples and modeling carbon-14 deposition rates using Gaussian Process regression
