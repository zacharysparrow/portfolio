As a computational chemistry PhD graduate, I have a passion for leveraging data-driven methodologies to address complex challenges. With extensive experience in data analysis, programming, and machine learning, I am adept at extracting actionable insights from diverse datasets. I am eager to apply my unique blend of scientific expertise to drive innovation as a data scientist in a dynamic and fast-paced industry.

## Work Experience

### Postdoctoral Research Associate  
Cornell University (*May 2023 - Present*)
- Engineered deep learning pipeline to guide the experimental valorization of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to pre-recycled strengths
- Developed sensitivity analysis technique to elucidate the roles of data and physical constraints on the accuracy of quantum chemistry approximations and suggest routes towards improvement

### Graduate Research Assistant  
Cornell University (*Aug. 2017 - May 2023*)
- Constructed a new quantum chemical approximation that leverages both machine learning and physical principles, reliably decreasing error by ~15%
- Designed, built, and analyzed two benchmark-quality quantum chemical databases to diagnose shortcomings in approximate quantum chemistry methods, resulting in a new general error analysis framework
- Developed an efficient black box algorithm to estimate electron interaction energies in large-scale systems, thereby extending applicability to systems orders of magnitude larger than historically possible
- Selected to participate in fully funded 3 month long program to define future research goals for the field at the UCLA Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics
- Mentored 6 undergraduate researchers across 4 distinct quantum chemistry projects

### Undergraduate Researcher
St. Olaf College (*Aug. 2015 - Aug. 2017*)
- Awarded competitive St. Olaf Center for Interdisciplinary Research Fellowship for outstanding research bridging chemistry, mathematics, and computer science
- Designed and implemented an efficient algorithm for high-resolution image analysis of high-speed gas flows
- Served as formal consultant for other undergraduate researchers with mathematics, statistics, and computer science questions

### Visitin Undergraduate Research Assistant  
MIT (*June 2015 - Aug. 2015*)
- Reconstructed historical Saharan dust transport over the Atlantic ocean by analyzing deep-sea sediment samples and modeling carbon-14 deposition rates using Gaussian Process regression
